# 🌍 Planora

**Discover. Plan. Experience.**

Planora is a travel planning web application where users can **discover, create and share real travel plans created by real people**, not generic recommendations generated by algorithms.

Each plan represents a concrete experience in a specific city — such as food routes, cultural visits, nature activities or nightlife plans — designed to inspire other travelers through authentic experiences.

- Inspiration from real people  
- Simple and intuitive user experience  
- Scalable architecture for future social features (auth, likes, personalization)
